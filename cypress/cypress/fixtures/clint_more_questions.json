I graduated from Paramount and a couple of years after I finished high school, I joined the US Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate. I served on an aircraft carrier for eight years and then afterwards, I went to the United States Navy Reserve. During that time I started going to school with some of the abundant benefits that the military reserve has given me and I started working with various companies.",
